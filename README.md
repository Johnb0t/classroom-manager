to do
-----
- update tiers for my students
- efficiency - instead of putting students into an array and checking if the randomly picked student is in the array
	- randomly pick a student and remove that student from a single list (maybe clone it from students)
- use classroom filter
	- //wrong need to find the length of students that are present for both classes, for just 1024 or 1025

	input:
		a1
		b1
		c2
		d2
		e3
		f3
		g4
		h4
		i5
		j5
		k5
		l6

	groups of 3 to 4:
		a1, b1, c2, d2 

		a1, b1

		c2, d2

	* 
		I want a group of 3, but if there's 1 left over then I want two groups of 2, but if there are 2 left over then I want a group of 3 and a group of 2 in the same tier or up by 1 


done
-----
- make it so it fills the table before moving to the next one
- make it not break if there is more seating than students
